All the SVG images in this folder are created by me, using Inkscape. No images are downloaded from the Internet, not even one pixel.

Since I copied the screenshot (when the scale factor is 1.0) pixel by pixel, they should be exactly the same with the real system buttons, in theory.

Anyone can use them freely.
