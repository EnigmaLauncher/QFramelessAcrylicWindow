# QFramelessAcrylicWindow
ðŸ’« Used for the main program window, with support for framelessness, acrylic and other features! ðŸ’«

The new window gives support for:
* rounded and frameless, as in Windows 11
* support the ability to deploy and select (as in Windows 11)
* Cross-platform UI (Windows, Linux, macOS) 

Based on a project from [wangwenx190](https://github.com/wangwenx190/framelesshelper), which is thanks a lot!
